## My process
I first tried to position the texts and images with HTML moreover I added some
classes so that I can position the image, then proceeded with CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I recalled forms, position, dislay block and inline block elements I haven't introduced 
favicon I knew how to do it though.

### Continued development

I want to lean more about how to position the images and combine them as a whole
such as here in div contaners I put my h2, h3 and p tags however, i was not sure how
to align images next to one another, moreover how to manipulate overall properties.
